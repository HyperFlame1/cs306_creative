<h2>Client Witness for the Defense — Stacy Johnson</h2>

    <h3>Witness Details</h3>
    <h4>Statement</h4>
    <p>I joined Shenanigans Software, Inc. straight out of college after previously interning with the
      company the summer of my Junior year. When I was an intern, I mainly performed menial tasks such
      as making copies and brewing coffee for the full time employees, but I still learned the ropes of
      the job nonetheless. When I received an offer for a full time position following my graduation, I
      was somewhat reluctant to take the position because I did not want to be making coffee for the rest
      of my career. However, my hard work during the internship was recognized, and I was given the
      responsibility of helping manage the payroll for our employees. I have access to a database that
      logs all employee work hours so that I can properly compensate our hard working employees.
    </p>


    <p>A few months ago, the employee in charge of hiring for ten years left the company after accepting
      an HR position at Boolgle, which left the HR department in dire need of someone who specialized in
      the hiring process. The head of the HR department, who was in charge of me during my internship, saw
      my potential as an excellent hiring manager despite my lack of experience. After receiving some general
      pointers from a few people who have had hiring experience, I was tasked with hiring the position of
      Assistant System Administrator, which had recently been created to alleviate the duties performed by our
      current System Administrators. After an extensive interviewing process, Shauna Pauls was chosen as our
      new Assistant System Administrator, since she was the most qualified for the position out of our
      applicants.</p>

    <p>Shauna appeared to excel at her duties over the past few months and she received numerous compliments
      from employees in other departments. During the last pay cycle, Shauna requested a meeting with me about
      her current pay. After talking about how tired she was from working frequent overtime hours, she requested
      compensation for the overtime hours that she was working. Since I had experience with the inner workings of
      the employee payroll, I had payed many of our employees for their overtime hours, but only employees that
      were not “computer professionals” and employees in administrative positions. I told her that she was not
      eligible for overtime hours because she was technically a computer professional, which is exempt from
      overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act. After telling her this, she became rather angry and
      threatened to sue our company to get her compensation. I told her that she was being unreasonable and that
      I was familiar with who can and cannot receive overtime pay, which caused her to storm out of my office
      while mumbling angrily to herself.</p>

    <p>When I reported this to the head of the HR department, he was confident in my assessment of the situation
      and that nothing serious would arise from the situation.</p>
    <h4>Secret Information</h4>
    <p>Stacy conspired with Michael Morris to cut costs by hiring a single, overtime-exempt employee to fill two
    roles.  Michael was originally looking for both another full-time Assistant System Administrator and a full-
    time IT staffer, but admitted to Stacy that there might not be quite enough work for both positions.  Due to
    her understanding of the FLSA, Stacy knows that an office IT helper would likely have to be paid overtime, so
    she asked Micheal if he would be willing to have an employee that only partially worked on sysadmin stuff, to
    which he agreed.</p>
    <p>Stacy then shuffled the stack of resumes and randomly pulled out Shauna’s resume for the selection
      process, as she is relatively computer illiterate and does not understand technical jargon.</p>
    <p>If questioned about this, Stacy should insist that it was originally Michael's idea, and during their
      discussions he insisted that his department would be fine hiring only one person.  Stacy should emphasize
      that it had very little to do with her beyond the actual hire, and she asked Michael several times whether
    he was sure he wanted to hire just one person.</p>

    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <p>Being a recent college graduate, Stacy barely has any actual experience with her job, which may reduce the
      strength of her testimony. Shauna is the first employee that Stacy has hired, so she may have made some
      mistakes during the hiring process. Proving that Stacy has no useful knowledge of computers could alter
      Shauna’s classification as a computer professional.</p>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <p>Stacy is well aware of the exemptions in the FLSA, since she was responsible for paying all employees
      regardless of their exemption status. Stacy personally hired Shauna, so she knows the details of her
      contract and what tasks Shauna is expected to perform. She also has access to the hours worked by each
      employee, so she knows when someone has worked overtime.</p>
