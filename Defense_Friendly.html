<h2>Friendly Witness for the Defense â€” Michael Trump</h2>

      <h3>Witness Details</h3>
      <h4>Statement</h4>
      <p> I have been working at Shenanigans Software, Inc. for 9 years already. I started as
        a Systems Administrator and have been as a Head Systems Administrator for 6 years, where I have my own
        team that consist of five System Administrators. My duties include assigning tasks to both System Administrators,
        making sure that the server infrastructure and the process deployment works properly. Here, at Shenanigans Software,
        Inc., Systems Administrator's' duties include maintaining, installing, configuring, upgrading the servers of
        the infrastructure and manage continuous deployment of processes. Additionally, I assign my SysAdmins to perform
        IT duties, such as troubleshooting computers, installing and configuring computer hardware operating systems and
        applications. In other words, we have a shift rotation policy where each of my SysAdmins performs IT duties for one full-time day.</p>

      <p>Before hiring Shauna, my team was assigned to urgently upgrade the servers' software and change
        the databases infrastructure. The software behind our servers was getting outdated, which caused consistent crashes;
        we had to also change our database storage machines to modern ones and as well as add other machines in order to store
        more data. It all required the skills and working hours of our SysAdmins, including the ones that had to do IT duties.
      </p>

      <p>Then, I asked Stacy Johnson (HR) to hire an Assistant System Administrator to perform IT tasks initially
        until we were done with upgrading the infrastructure. As a result, Stacy hired Shauna. Shauna was new to the field of
        System Administrator, and in order to upgrade our infrastructure within the given deadline of one month, I decided to
        assign all of my current SysAdmins to work on the infrastructure, and assign Shauna IT duties until we were done with
        upgrading the systems.
      </p>

      <p>Shauna was performing really well by doing the IT duties, and she seemed to be happy with it, as I had
        a view her workspace from my desk. After we were done with upgrading our infrastructure, I decided to keep my SysAdmins
        keep working on it, and have Shauna keep performing IT duties, because, like I said she seemed to enjoy doing those duties.
        I have never seen her sad when she was working here!
      </p>

      <h4>Secret Information</h4>
      <p>Micheal conspired with Stacy Johnson to cut costs by hiring a single, overtime-exempt employee to fill two
      roles.  Michael was originally looking for both another full-time Assistant System Administrator and a full-
      time IT staffer, but admitted to Stacy that there might not be quite enough work for both positions.  They
      eventually agreed that it was fine and hired Shauna.</p>
      <p>If questioned about this, Michael should say that he would have been fine with hiring two people, but Stacy
      insisted it was legal and would totally work out.</p>

      <h3>Evidence</h3>
      <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
      <p>Michael Trump, after finishing upgrading the infrastructure of the system with his SysAdmins, should have talked with Shauna whether she still wanted to keep performing IT duties. Such action decreases the strength of his testimony.</p>
      <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
      <p>According to Michael Trump, he had never seen Shauna complaining about anything while performing assigned IT tasks, instead she seemed to be very happy with her position. Secondly, Shauna was still classified as an Assistant System Administrator who was exempt from overtime pay by the FLSA section.</p>
