    <hr>

<h2>Client Witness for the Plaintiff — Shauna Pauls</h2>

    <h3>Witness Details</h3>
    <h4>Voluntary Information</h4>
    <p>I was hired by Shenanigans shortly after graduating college in 2015 as an Assistant System Administrator.  I was told that the SysAdmins typically handled IT support for the rest of the office, which tended to interfere with their actual work, especially on crunch days.  Crunch days are when software is pushed to production, or a database goes down, that kind of thing — the entire SysAdmin staff needs to be available.  My job description was to perform system administration tasks as directed and to perform office IT support on an as-needed basis.  In my contract, I was also informed that as a “computer employee” I was exempt from overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
    <p>Once I started, my supervisor, Michael Trump, told me that he would likely assign me most of the IT work; this made sense as it had been hinted that I was hired to take some of the pressure off the team.  I ended up being instructed to perform my SysAdmin tasks in the morning, then make rounds through the office after my lunch break to see if anyone needed help.  The company has an IT help desk website where people can request help, but most people don’t know how to use it so they just don’t.  Because there are about 150 people in the office, these rounds would end up taking most of the afternoon, after which I would have a few remaining SysAdmin tasks to perform.  Typically I’d average an hour of overtime per day on typical days, but that could go up to 4 hours on crunch days.  Of course, all my SysAdmin and IT hours were logged in our time tracker system under the appropriate categories.</p>
    <p>The IT tasks were things like making sure computers and other hardware were plugged in (power, video, sound, etc.), helping people set up two-factor authentication, finding “lost” or “deleted” files or emails, setting up accounts on spare computers for interns, cleaning keyboards, refilling paper & ink/toner in printers, and helping people set up wireless & printer access on their desktop computers.</p>
    <p>Occasionally I’d complain online about how tiring my job was.  After about a year, someone suggested that I might have been incorrectly classified as exempt from overtime pay.  At this point I read the section in the FLSA, and it sounded like most of the stuff I was doing was menial tasks and didn’t really fit into the “computer employee” description.  I mentioned this to Michael, but he just said I’d have to talk to HR about stuff like that.</p>
    <p>On my next round I stopped by Stacy Johnson’s office over in HR and mentioned that I didn’t think the exemption applied to me.  Stacy seemed distracted by other work and didn’t seem to want to talk about it, and hardly looked away from her work.  She said there was nothing she could do; I was hired as a computer professional and was exempt.  After a while it was clear I wasn’t making any headway.  Frustrated, I emailed a lawyer that evening and set up an appointment.</p>
    <h4>Secret Information</h4>
    <p>Shenanigans software has an IT ticket tracking system in place, but Shauna doesn't use it and encourages the other office folks not to create tickets.  Instead, she tells them she'll deal with whatever problems the might have during her daily rounds.  Shen then spends a good deal of this time chatting with the people she is helping, and there is no record of how many IT issues she is actually solving.  She also noticed & enjoyed Gerald's attentions, spending quite a bit of time chatting with him.</p>
    <p>Note that the IT ticket system is separate from the system used to track hours, which would be required for any government contractor.</p>
    <p>In addition, when talking to Stacy Shauna became frustrated and raised her voice, threatening to sue the company before she had talked to a lawyer about the validity of her complaint.</p>

    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Shauna recorded 10~15 hours of overtime per 2-week pay period</li>
      <li>40-60% of Shauna’s work involved office IT tasks, depending on the day</li>
      <li>Although not strictly officially, Shauna was hired to alleviate the SysAdmin’s workload by taking over their IT tasks rather than as just another SysAdmin</li>
      <li>The IT tasks performed by Shauna were very menial and aren't clearly similar to those listed for 'computer professionals' in the FLSA</li>
      <li>The response from HR didn’t seem to actually consider Shauna’s argument</li>
      <li>While other sysadmins also worked overtime, they were definitely exempt due to the tasks they were performing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Shauna was unfamiliar with the actual wording of the FLSA until a year into her job</li>
      <li>Shauna was very new to the field, inexperienced in the workplace & employment laws</li>
      <li>The other sysadmins (her peers) also worked overtime</li>
      <li>Shauna does not have a paper trail for initial question to HR (asked in-person rather than via email)</li>
      <li>There is no documentation for Shauna's use of her time doing IT tasks</li>
      <li>Could argue that if she was more efficient with her rounds she could have avoided overtime</li>
      <li>Shauna’s IT work was mostly done after lunch break — before she started her “regularly assigned tasks” related to her job description</li>
    </ul>
