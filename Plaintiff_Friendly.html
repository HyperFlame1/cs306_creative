<h2>Friendly Witness for the Plaintiff â€” Gerald Mitchell</h2>

    <h3>Witness Details</h3>
    <h4>Voluntary Information</h4>
    <p>
      I have worked in payroll for Shananigans for 11 years. For the last 3 years I have been the head of the department. We originallydidn't have an IT department, or help desk website; being a tech company, this wasn't viewed as a very big problem since most employees are savvy enough to fix there own problems most of the time. This was never quite the case for our department, we may have one or two employees who we could rely on, but as the company grew there became more problems than they could be expected to handle and still do their own job. About 6 years back this was brought up, but instead of a dedicated department we got some of the more tech savvy guys from other departments we could call on. I've always been an advocate for an IT department, but was always told we didn't have room in the budget. About 3 years ago, just before Shauna started working at Shananigans, we got something of a department. It's a few people who mostly sit in tight on their floor in their broom closet. They provided an IT help desk website, that allowed us to submit trouble tickets, but most people are either not aware of it or unclear how it works. I've always preferred to talk to people in person, but nobody ever answers the phone down there. Apprently they find something to do and I'm told they are working, but I never see it.

      This last year or so, our help has mostly come from Shauna. She stops by everyday and we always have something we need help with. Admittedly we have some older employees who may type well enough and turn the computer on and write an email, but most of the complexities of computers escape them. We give Shauna a lot to do somedays, but she is always very patient and helpful. She helped me with network connectivity issues not but a few weeks ago, and she didn't just fix it, but showed me what the problem was and helped me understand how to fix it if it occurred again. She is well liked in our department and we certainly give her a lot of work. I've let her know how much we appreciate her. She even gave us her extension so I can call if we need any help, and she answers her phone! In more than one supervisor meeting I've praised her for the work she does for us.

      I found out later that she isn't from the IT department, but is assigned to do IT work as needed, but I see her way more often than our official IT employees. I've never seen her work in a System Admin capacity. Even when she isn't helping me or my department, I see her around the office helping others with various IT related problems. You know, head under the desk, you're computer isn't plugged in sort of stuff. I always leave before her, even on the occasion I stay late. Even though she makes rounds in the later half of her day, she has been known to come help us if we call her extension.

    <h4>Secret Information</h4>
    <p>
      I generally only see Shauna around mid afternoon and while she always responds to her phone, I've learned she isn't always able to come right up to fix our problems in the early morning. I tend to wait until Shauna is available, and only submit trouble tickets when absolutely necessary in the morning.

    <p>
      I have made several passes on Shauna without any positive results. Since she has made it clear she isn't interested, I have backed off and kept our relationship purely professional, but I may call on her because I like her over the IT department people. I also may have faked one or more "issues" just so I could see her, but not since she rejected me.

    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <p>He attests to Shauna working past normal hours.
      He can attest to seeing her do IT work more than Admin work.</p>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <p>Has knowledge of her work schedule and constraints and that she does do System Admin work in the morning.
      He gives her more work and avoids the IT department. It isn't necessarily that the job requires more IT work than the IT department can handle, it's that they call her instead of the IT department. Might be the source of her being over worked in IT.
      Has fabricated IT work just to see Shauna.</p>
