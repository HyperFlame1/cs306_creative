    <hr>

<h1 id="ta">Trial Analysis</h1>
      <h3>Analysis of Plaintiff Arguments</h3>
      <p id="break_lines">
        The plaintiff, Shauna Pauls, must prove she is entitled to overtime pay for the IT tasks that she performs in
        Shenanigans Software, Inc.. In order for the plaintiff to prove this, she must show that she is not exempt from
        overtime pay under the FLSA. The FLSA exempts “any employee who is a computer systems analyst, computer programmer,
        software engineer, or other similarly skilled worker, whose primary duty…” from overtime pay. Typical activities that
        an IT support tech may perform are not exempt. So, there are a few ways she can show that she is not exempt. For one,
        she can argue that her primary duties are that of an IT support tech rather than that of her official job title, an
        Assistant System Administrator, through her own testimony. Gerald Mitchell’s witness statement also shows that he has
        seen the plaintiff doing IT work more often than she does SysAdmin work, so that evidence can be used to argue that IT
        is her primary duty. She can emphasize that the majority of her tasks were menial, and therefore not exempt under 29 USC § 213(a)(17).
        The defense may try to counter with the fact that the other SysAdmins also worked overtime but were still exempt; the plaintiff should
        emphasize that she should not be considered a SysAdmin and was incorrectly classified as exempt. Michael Trump’s witness statement
        includes the fact that he asked Stacy Johnson to hire an Assistant System Administrator to explicitly perform IT tasks. The plaintiff
        can use this information to argue that she was only hired to perform such duties, and therefore her job title and classification as
        an exempt Assistant System Administrator is incorrect. Plaintiff can argue that she has been working excessive amounts of overtime;
        she recorded 10-15 hours of overtime over a 2-week period. Plaintiff should express her displeasure with having to work for hundreds
        of extra hours beyond her normal work hours and not being compensated for that time.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        <i>Yuen v. U.S. Asia Commercial Development Corp.</i> asserted that if the plaintiff can show that her primary duties
        would be done by an employee compensated with overtime pay, then she is not exempt. This case was held in a
        Virginia court and has been cited several times with no negative treatment, and therefore holds precedent.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        <i>Icicle Seafoods, Inc. v. Worthington et al.</i> can be used to the plaintiff’s advantage; she may argue that just
        because she is associated with the other system administrators does not actually classify her as a system administrator.
        This case was decided in the US Supreme Court and has been followed and cited a substantial number of times, and therefore
        holds precedent.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        <i>Howard E. Shockley, et al. v. City of Newport News</i> is helpful to the plaintiff in that it is a case in which
        employees were wrongly misclassified as exempt. While their official title may have rendered them exempt, their day
        to day primary duties were not considered exempt. The plaintiff can use this to bolster her “primary duty” argument.
        The case was decided in the 4th Circuit court. It’s been criticized and distinguished on several occasions, but has been
        cited many times and has been followed as recently as 2014, and thus still holds precedent.
      </p>

      <h3>Analysis of Defense Arguments</h3>
      <p id="break_lines">
        In order for the Defense to defeat the plaintiff’s arguments, the defense must show that the Plaintiff is subject to the
        overtime exemption outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The Defense must show that the Plaintiff was classified
        correctly as a “computer employee” under 29 USCS § 213(a)(17).  She meets the wage requirement of at least $27.63 an hour,
        and her system administrator duties as stated appear to require “the application of systems analysis techniques and procedures…”
        29 USCS § 213(a)(17)(A). It is evident through employee testimony that the Plaintiff in fact does perform her system administrator
        duties and is seen performing those tasks in the morning.  To counter the Plaintiff’s argument of “primary duty,” the Defense can
        point out that 29 CFR § 541.400(a) contains no mention of “primary duty” for computer employees — this test in 29 CFR § 541.103(a)
        is for managers and executives.  <i>Terri Jones & Beatrice Moon v. Virginia Oil Company, Inc.</i> clarified that employees who are employed
        in a managerial capacity but perform tasks that qualify for overtime pay are still exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA.
        The opinion also stated that the overtime pay exemption is based on the skills of the person, whether they use them or not.
        This case which has received mostly positive treatment should help the defense show that performing extra tasks does not disqualify
        Shauna’s exemption.  <i>Carroll M. Counts, et al. v. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company</i> established that employers have no duty to
        treat employees as exempt or nonexempt depending on their activities at any given time — it is employees that are exempt, not activities.
        Simply put, time spent performing tasks considered “non-exempt” does not change the employee’s actual exemption status.
        The defense client has a working knowledge of the FLSA and considered it when completing payroll, which could strengthen the argument of
        the defense as well.  <i>Counts v. SCE&G</i> has received significant positive usage with almost no dissent, so it will still have value for
        the arguments of the defense.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        Even if the Plaintiff does not fall under “computer employee” definition, the Defense has a reasonable argument that she falls under
        “professional” definition from 29 CFR § 541.300(a) — her “primary duty is the performance of work” requiring advanced knowledge/degree
        involving “prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.”  They can argue that even the Plaintiff’s IT work required
        specialized knowledge — not everyone can fix general computer issues.  <i>Nancy A. Williams v. Genex Services, LLC.</i> is also useful
        for classifying what encompasses a “professional.” While distinguished by a lower court, this case has been mostly used by other
        courts in a positive manner, which points to the merits of the decision.  It strongly emphasizes the spirit of the FLSA, which was
        intended to protect lower-level workers from “substandard wages and oppressive working hours,” not upper-level management or
        well-paid professionals.  Similarly to Williams who made $80,000 per year, the Plaintiff is far from poor as she makes nearly $58,000.
        Additionally, if it comes to light that the Plaintiff has been very inefficient during her work hours and often performs her tasks at a
        lazy pace, the Defense can argue that this has confounded their duty to “prove by clear and convincing evidence that an employee
        qualifies for exemption.” All three of these cases mention the FLSA’s general rule-of-thumb which states that an employee’s primary duty
        can be inferred from what they spent 50% or more of their time doing, with the caveat that this is not the sole measure of primary duty
        if a more appropriate metric exists for a given case.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        Finally, the Defense could use the precedent set in <i>Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Jesse Busk, et al.</i> to additionally claim that
        the time the Plaintiff spent performing IT tasks may not have even been compensable.  The case shows that only activities considered to
        be essential to the completion of the job are considered a principal part of the job.  Just because employer requires something does not
        mean it is compensable — even the warehouse workers undergoing security screenings after work were not compensated for that activity
        because it was not an intrinsic part of their product handling duties.  If the Plaintiff states that her IT work was completed after
        lunch break but before she returned to her primary duties, the defense can argue that her extra work is classified as a preliminary
        noncompensable activity.  While most of these cases were decided in the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, <i>Integrity v. Busk</i> received
        a decision at the Supreme Court. <i>Integrity v. Busk</i> has received some negative analysis, but is still nationally binding as it has not
        been overturned at the current time.
      </p>

      <h3>Balance of the Case</h3>
      <p id="break_lines">
        This case is fairly balanced and offers each party a relatively equal chance at victory. The plaintiff’s contract specifies that she is exempt
        from overtime pay, due to her main job being an Assistant System Administrator. This is not quite accurate due to the fact that she spends most
        of her work time doing menial IT tasks - not the system administration work that her contract states. However, her contract did inform her that
        she would be classified as a “computer employee”, which happens to be exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA. The plaintiff can attempt to argue
        that she was incorrectly classified as exempt, utilizing the fact she performs more IT tasks than actual System Administrator tasks. Several cases
        establish a “fifty percent” rule, which aids the plaintiff in establishing her primary duty. However, some other cases state that “time alone” is
        not the sole test to determine whether an employee is considered exempt. The plaintiff’s side can emphasize that she was sloughing through menial
        tasks for hours on end, while not receiving the overtime pay rate. Gerald Mitchell can testify for having seen her performing IT tasks more often
        than not. However, the defense has quite a few supporting cases for establishing the plaintiff as exempt.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        Various pieces of secret information are available to assist the plaintiff in her argument. Gerald Mitchell was at one point romantically interested
        in Shauna, creating fake “issues” in order to see her more often. The plaintiff can use this information to determine that she was performing even more
        IT tasks than what is typically normal. Stacy Johnson, the person responsible for hiring Shauna Pauls and classifying her as a “computer employee”, is
        computer illiterate. Johnson has very little knowledge of computers, and therefore the plaintiff can use this to argue that Johnson is unfit for
        classifying the plaintiff as exempt. Johnson is also fairly inexperienced with her job, further reducing the classification’s validity. Michael Trump
        specifically contacted Stacy Johnson to hire someone who could perform the IT tasks so that the other System Administrators could focus on upgrading
        the infrastructure. The plaintiff could use this information to argue that she was only hired for such a task, and that she really shouldn’t be considered
        a System Administrator. Even after the infrastructure upgrade was complete, Michael Trump elected to have the plaintiff continue to do IT tasks, since he
        assumed that she was content with doing so. Once again, Shauna can argue that she is doing more IT tasks than a normal System Administrator.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        The defense also has a few pieces of secret information that may prove to be useful for their side of the case. Shauna was inefficient when performing her
        IT duties; she spent quite a bit of time chatting while doing her rounds, which resulted in her working longer hours. If she had worked more efficiently,
        then she would have reduced her number of overtime hours. Gerald Mitchell hardly sees the plaintiff in the morning; the defense can make the conclusion
        that for a large portion of her work day, she is performing system administration tasks.
      </p>
      <p id="break_lines">
        The secret info helps the plaintiff much more than the defense side (because the supporting cases are skewed in favor of the defense). The plaintiff relies
        on the secret information to assert that her primary tasks align with IT, and that her title as a System Administrator is a mislabel. The secret information
        also serves to discredit Stacy Johnson’s position as a hiring manager, and makes it apparent that Shauna was only hired to alleviate the rest of the System
        Administrators from having to perform IT tasks themselves. The defense, however, can discredit the plaintiff’s overtime hours, and assert that she still
        performs her duty as a System Administrator.

      <p id="break_lines">
        <i>Jones v. VA Oil Company</i> mainly deals with classifying the overtime exemption status of an employee upon describing the actual duties of an employee.
        The percentage of work time spent performing a certain task can help determine if that employee’s primary duties will classify them as an employee to
        which the overtime exemption statute can be applied. The decision
        made in the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit holds precedent in our area, and it has been
        overturned neither by the court itself nor a higher court. The decision has been positively treated
        in cases that have cited it with most courts following the decision. However, some lower courts
        have utilized the decision in other contexts, but further research does not indicate that the
        decision has been misused. This case will help the defense with their argument in our case. The
        plaintiff in this case is employed in a managerial capacity, but they regularly perform duties that
        non-exempt employees perform. The decision shows that an employee can still be exempt from
        the overtime statute even if they perform extra duties that would normally be compensated with
        overtime pay for non-managerial employees. Thus, this could help the defense in our case
        possibly show that the exemption still applies.

      <p id="break_lines">
        <i>Yuen v. U.S. Asia Commercial Development Corp.</i> discusses whether an employee who occasionally performs the duties of an employee who is exempt from overtime
        pay still falls under the category of overtime exemption. This questions the classification of the employee based on the normal daily duties of said employee
        This case suggests that even if some duties that are considered exempt from overtime pay are performed by the employee, they still may be entitled to overtime
        pay if their main duties consist of work that is not overtime exempt. This decision was made in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
        which holds precedence over our case. There have been no decisions made by a higher court to contradict this decision. Upon reviewing the cases that cited this decision,
        it appears that the decision has been positively used without mistreatment that would call its validity into question. This case should help the plaintiff’s side
        demonstrate that the extent of the plaintiff’s duties do not qualify them as a computer professional, even if they occasionally perform tasks that designate them as such.
        If the plaintiff’s side can show that the plaintiff’s primary duties would be done by an employee who can be compensated by overtime pay, then this case could prove to be useful.

        Thirty-two current and former police officers brought this case against the City of
        Newport News in an attempt to obtain back-pay for overtime work. They claimed that the City
        had improperly classified them as salaried managing employees. While the Appeals Court
        affirmed that most of the officers were in fact managers and only due compensation due to
        former regulations, the Media Regulations Sergeants were found to have been mis-classified.
        While they were officers nominally paid on a salary, their primary duties were answering
        phones, talking to the press, and acting as censors for active cases. This, combined with 29
        CFR § 541.400(a), could support the Plaintiff in arguing that her job title and primary job
        description alone should not exempt her from overtime pay. Instead, the actual work activities
        she performed on a day-to-day basis must be taken into account.

      <p id="break_lines">
        <i>ISS v. Busk</i> is a unanimous United States Supreme Court decision that clarifies
        compensable work and work-related activities under the Portal-to-Portal Act (29 U.S.C. §254(a)).
        Former employees of ​ISS sued the company to obtain compensation for time spent in required
        security screenings after work each day. They claimed that as the screenings were required,
        they fell under “principal [work] activities;” the Supreme Court found that simply being required
        was not a sufficient test to define something as a principal activity. For example, battery plant
        employees donning protective clothing or meatpackers sharpening their knives would be
        compensable activities, as without performing them the employee’s activities would be
        impossible or at least severely hampered. On the other hand, poultry-plant employees waiting
        to don protective gear was very similar yet too far removed from the actual activities of their
        work. The SC held that ISS could have eliminated the screenings completely without impacting
        the worker’s ability to perform their jobs, and that only “work that the employee is ​
        employed to perform [sic]” is compensable. The Defense may use this to argue that as Shauna’s IT tasks
        were not required for the execution of her main duty in performing system administration, that
        the IT tasks were non-principal. She would not be entitled to overtime pay as no employer may
        be required to “pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on account of … (2) activities
        which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities.” 29 U.S.C.
        §254(a).

      <p id="break_lines">
        This case revolves revolves around the classification of employees working on a barge
        at sea as “seamen”. Initially, Worthington et al. had brought suit against Icicle Seafoods, Inc. to
        recover overtime pay which they believed they were entitled to under the FLSA. The district
        court for the Western District of Washington held that these employees were exempt from
        overtime pay due to being “seamen” in 29 USCS § 213(b)(6). Worthington et al. appealed, and
        the appellate 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision. The Court of Appeals believed
        that the respondents were not “seamen” but instead industrial maintenance employees on a
        non-moving barge. The case came to the Supreme Court, which then vacated and remanded
        the case back to the Court of Appeals. “How the respondents spent their working time on board
        the Arctic Star is a question of fact. The question whether their particular activities excluded
        them from the overtime benefits of the FLSA is a question of law”. Justice Stevens dissented,
        with the opinion that he would have affirmed the judgment of the 9th Circuit court, and “the
        facts are undisputed”. “[One] does not become a ‘seaman’ under the FLSA merely by
        performing services aboard a vessel on navigable waters.” In this case, Worthington et al. were
        assumed to be seamen because they worked at sea. Even though partial amounts of their work
        may have been classified as “maritime” and therefore something a “seaman” might do, their
        primary duties as industrial maintenance employees are nonexempt from overtime pay.
        The legal elements this case affects are whether the plaintiff was defined as exempt by
        their employer, and whether the employer properly defined this. It appears that the plaintiffs
        were indeed defined as exempt, but not properly defined, since it wasn’t very clear whether they
        were classified as “seamen” or as the industrial workers they were initially hired as. As for the
        current precedential status, the Supreme Court case has been cited a great many times,
        followed 19 times, and distinguished on three occasions. A question of fact vs. a question of law
        is a key quote in many of the citing cases. In our scenario, this helps the plaintiff Pauls. She can
        argue that just because she is associated with the software programmers, does not mean that
        her primary duty is doing software programming, and therefore her “particular activities” doing
        mostly IT support would not exclude her from overtime benefits.

      <p id="break_lines">
        This case focuses on the classification of an employee as a “professional”, which makes
        them exempt from overtime pay. Nancy Williams, a registered nurse, worked for Genex
        Services as a field medical case manager (FMCM). She filed suit against Genex, claiming that
        Genex is required to pay her for overtime under the FLSA. Under the FLSA, “professional
        employees” are exempt from receiving overtime pay. She claimed that she spent more than fifty
        percent of her time while working performing menial tasks and that even a “lay person” could
        perform. And even though she may use her professional knowledge as a registered nurse on
        occasion, she does so much less than the fifty percent threshold set by § 541.700(b). However,
        the court found that the amount of time an employee spends doing exempt work does not
        indicate that the employee is a learned professional or not. “Time alone… is not the sole test”.
        Williams’ work record reflected that a very large majority of her work involved the application of
        her skills and knowledge as a registered nurse, and her resume indicated that she worked as a
        case manager. The court then notes that the FLSA was not designed to protect Williams due to
        her high salary ($80,000/y); it was intended to protect “low paid ‘rank and file’ employees.”
        This case actually affects all of the legal elements of our case. The plaintiff was indeed
        defined as exempt by her employer, who classified her as a “professional employee”. Genex
        defined this correctly; both the district and appellate courts ruled in Genex’s favor. The plaintiff
        expected that her type of work should be not exempt, claiming that she did non-exempt work
        greater than fifty percent of the time. The court event mentioned that the FLSA was intended to
        protect low paid employees, and not people with higher salaries and managerial positions such
        as Williams. ​
        <i>Williams v. Genex</i> has been distinguished in one case, but was followed in another
        case and cited several times, so it appears that the case still holds merit. In our scenario, the
        defense could use this to help their side by showing that the amount of time spent doing
        nonexempt work does not change their classification as an exempt employee.

      <p id="break_lines">
        The plaintiff was employed at a newspaper as a mechanical superintendent; during this time he discovered that
        one of the operators below him made a higher salary but worked fewer hours.  He researched whether he was
        actually exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA, then demanded more pay in exchange for not pressing charges.
        When the newspaper declined, he left the company and brought the lawsuit, demanding overtime pay, liquidated,
        damages, and attorney’s fees from his former employer.  The case was initially decided against him, and the Appeals
        Court for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  The decision stated that the FLSA is intended to protect employees, and
        as such the employer has the burden of proof as to whether an employee’s role fits the exemptions.  The defendant
        had satisfied this, so it fell to the plaintiff to show that they were employed outside their role.  The plaintiff
        failed to do so; in addition, the court suspected he did not bring the case in good faith as there was evidence that
        he had good knowledge of the FLSA and was merely using it to bargain for a higher salary.

        month-long maintenance period.  In that period employees would be re-assigned as needed, the vast majority working
        overtime hours.  Some of these employees who were typically exempt from overtime pay under the FLSA were temporarily
        reassigned to non-exempt positions, but retained their regular pay.  Sixteen of these employees (and one other) filed
        against SCE&G to get overtime pay from this maintenance period.  Their claim was denied on the grounds that the FLSA
        does not in any way imply that employees should be treated as exempt or non-exempt depending on their current task.
        In addition, the opinion emphasizes that there is a rule-of-thumb that an employee’s primary duty under the FLSA is based
        on what they spend 50% or more of their time performing.
