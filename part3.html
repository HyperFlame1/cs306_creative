    <h1 id="bgs">Background / Scenario</h1>
    <h3>Background</h3>
      <p id="break_lines">In 2015, Shauna Pauls graduated college and soon landed a job at Shenanigans Software, Inc.  Shenanigans is a U.S. government contractor who provides software solutions to many branches of the federal government, including defense, homeland security, intelligence, and healthcare. When joining Shenanigans, Shauna's paperwork stated that she was to act as an Assistant System Administrator (which consisted of the following duties: managing continuous deployment of the processes and maintaining/installing/configuring/upgrading the servers) and perform in-office IT services for other employees on an as-needed basis, the same as her peers. Her starting salary was a generous but not unusual $28.00 an hour ($58,240 per year). However as ‘the new guy,’ all of these IT tasks were given to her so that the other System Administrators could focus on their corresponding duties. As Shauna was frequently required to work overtime to complete all the IT tasks, she asked to be paid an overtime rate but was told that as a System Administrator she was exempt from Fair Labor Standards special overtime rates.</p> 
      <p id="break_lines">Shauna then sued Shenanigans, contending that the majority of her work was menial and non-exempt.</p>

      <p id="break_lines">
        Jones v. VA Oil Company mainly deals with classifying the overtime exemption status of an employee upon describing the actual duties of an employee.
        The percentage of work time spent performing a certain task can help determine if that employee’s primary duties will classify them as an employee to
        which the overtime exemption statute can be applied. The decision
        made in the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit holds precedent in our area, and it has been
        overturned neither by the court itself nor a higher court. The decision has been positively treated
        in cases that have cited it with most courts following the decision. However, some lower courts
        have utilized the decision in other contexts, but further research does not indicate that the
        decision has been misused. This case will help the defense with their argument in our case. The
        plaintiff in this case is employed in a managerial capacity, but they regularly perform duties that
        non-exempt employees perform. The decision shows that an employee can still be exempt from
        the overtime statute even if they perform extra duties that would normally be compensated with
        overtime pay for non-managerial employees. Thus, this could help the defense in our case
        possibly show that the exemption still applies.

      <p id="break_lines">
        Yuen v. U.S. Asia Commercial Development Corp. discusses whether an employee who occasionally performs the duties of an employee who is exempt from overtime
        pay still falls under the category of overtime exemption. This questions the classification of the employee based on the normal daily duties of said employee
        This case suggests that even if some duties that are considered exempt from overtime pay are performed by the employee, they still may be entitled to overtime
        pay if their main duties consist of work that is not overtime exempt. This decision was made in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia,
        which holds precedence over our case. There have been no decisions made by a higher court to contradict this decision. Upon reviewing the cases that cited this decision,
        it appears that the decision has been positively used without mistreatment that would call its validity into question. This case should help the plaintiff’s side
        demonstrate that the extent of the plaintiff’s duties do not qualify them as a computer professional, even if they occasionally perform tasks that designate them as such.
        If the plaintiff’s side can show that the plaintiff’s primary duties would be done by an employee who can be compensated by overtime pay, then this case could prove to be useful.

      <p id="break_lines">
        Thirty-two current and former police officers brought this case against the City of
        Newport News in an attempt to obtain back-pay for overtime work. They claimed that the City
        had improperly classified them as salaried managing employees. While the Appeals Court
        affirmed that most of the officers were in fact managers and only due compensation due to
        former regulations, the Media Regulations Sergeants were found to have been mis-classified.
        While they were officers nominally paid on a salary, their primary duties were answering
        phones, talking to the press, and acting as censors for active cases. This, combined with 29
        CFR § 541.400(a), could support the Plaintiff in arguing that her job title and primary job
        description alone should not exempt her from overtime pay. Instead, the actual work activities
        she performed on a day-to-day basis must be taken into account.

      <p id="break_lines">
        ISS v. Busk is a unanimous United States Supreme Court decision that clarifies
        compensible work and work-related activities under the Portal-to-Portal Act (29 U.S.C. §254(a)).
        Former employees of ​ISS sued the company to obtain compensation for time spent in required
        security screenings after work each day. They claimed that as the screenings were required,
        they fell under “principal [work] activities;” the Supreme Court found that simply being required
        was not a sufficient test to define something as a principal activity. For example, battery plant
        employees donning protective clothing or meatpackers sharpening their knives would be
        compensible activities, as without performing them the employee’s activities would be
        impossible or at least severely hampered. On the other hand, poultry-plant employees waiting
        to don protective gear was very similar yet too far removed from the actual activities of their
        work. The SC held that ISS could have eliminated the screenings completely without impacting
        the worker’s ability to perform their jobs, and that only “work that the employee is ​
        employed to perform [sic]” is compensible. The Defense may use this to argue that as Shauna’s IT tasks
        were not required for the execution of her main duty in performing system administration, that
        the IT tasks were non-principal. She would not be entitled to overtime pay as no employer may
        be required to “pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on account of … (2) activities
        which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities.” 29 U.S.C.
        §254(a).

      <p id="break_lines">
        This case revolves revolves around the classification of employees working on a barge
        at sea as “seamen”. Initially, Worthington et al. had brought suit against Icicle Seafoods, Inc. to
        recover overtime pay which they believed they were entitled to under the FLSA. The district
        court for the Western District of Washington held that these employees were exempt from
        overtime pay due to being “seamen” in 29 USCS § 213(b)(6). Worthington et al. appealed, and
        the appellate 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision. The Court of Appeals believed
        that the respondents were not “seamen” but instead industrial maintenance employees on a
        non-moving barge. The case came to the Supreme Court, which then vacated and remanded
        the case back to the Court of Appeals. “How the respondents spent their working time on board
        the Arctic Star is a question of fact. The question whether their particular activities excluded
        them from the overtime benefits of the FLSA is a question of law”. Justice Stevens dissented,
        with the opinion that he would have affirmed the judgement of the 9th Circuit court, and “the
        facts are undisputed”. “[One] does not become a ‘seaman’ under the FLSA merely by
        performing services aboard a vessel on navigable waters.” In this case, Worthington et al. were
        assumed to be seamen because they worked at sea. Even though partial amounts of their work
        may have been classified as “maritime” and therefore something a “seaman” might do, their
        primary duties as industrial maintenance employees are nonexempt from overtime pay.
        The legal elements this case affects are whether the plaintiff was defined as exempt by
        their employer, and whether the employer properly defined this. It appears that the plaintiffs
        were indeed defined as exempt, but not properly defined, since it wasn’t very clear whether they
        were classified as “seamen” or as the industrial workers they were initially hired as. As for the
        current precedential status, the Supreme Court case has been cited a great many times,
        followed 19 times, and distinguished on three occasions. A question of fact vs. a question of law
        is a key quote in many of the citing cases. In our scenario, this helps the plaintiff Pauls. She can
        argue that just because she is associated with the software programmers, does not mean that
        her primary duty is doing software programming, and therefore her “particular activities” doing
        mostly IT support would not exclude her from overtime benefits.

      <p id="break_lines">
        This case focuses on the classification of an employee as a “professional”, which makes
        them exempt from overtime pay. Nancy Williams, a registered nurse, worked for Genex
        Services as a field medical case manager (FMCM). She filed suit against Genex, claiming that
        Genex is required to pay her for overtime under the FLSA. Under the FLSA, “professional
        employees” are exempt from receiving overtime pay. She claimed that she spent more than fifty
        percent of her time while working performing menial tasks and that even a “lay person” could
        perform. And even though she may use her professional knowledge as a registered nurse on
        occasion, she does so much less than the fifty percent threshold set by § 541.700(b). However,
        the court found that the amount of time an employee spends doing exempt work does not
        indicate that the employee is a learned professional or not. “Time alone… is not the sole test”.
        Williams’ work record reflected that a very large majority of her work involved the application of
        her skills and knowledge as a registered nurse, and her resume indicated that she worked as a
        case manager. The court then notes that the FLSA was not designed to protect Williams due to
        her high salary ($80,000/y); it was intended to protect “low paid ‘rank and file’ employees.”
        This case actually affects all of the legal elements of our case. The plaintiff was indeed
        defined as exempt by her employer, who classified her as a “professional employee”. Genex
        defined this correctly; both the district and appellate courts ruled in Genex’s favor. The plaintiff
        expected that her type of work should be not exempt, claiming that she did non-exempt work
        greater than fifty percent of the time. The court event mentioned that the FLSA was intended to
        protect low paid employees, and not people with higher salaries and managerial positions such
        as Williams. ​
        Williams v. Genex has been distinguished in one case, but was followed in another
        case and cited several times, so it appears that the case still holds merit. In our scenario, the
        defense could use this to help their side by showing that the amount of time spent doing
        nonexempt work does not change their classification as an exempt employee.

      <p id="break_lines">
        Schmidt v. Bartech Group, Inc., et al. discusses whether an employee who is paid on
        hourly basis and who is exempt based on certain provisions of Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
        can still be able to get paid for the overtime hours that he/she has worked. The case affects one
        of the legal elements in our proposed case that is FLSA exemptions. The decision of the case
        suggests that if an employee falls under the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions of the
        FLSA, then he/she is exempt from the overtime payments. According to the court's decision, the
        employee (plaintiff) failed to prove that he should have been paid for overtime hours because he
        did not have a claim for payment of his hourly wage for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per
        week. The decision of the case was ruled by the United States Court of Appeals For the Fourth
        Circuit, and it does not have any subsequent appellate history. It contains citing decisions with
        no analysis assigned. This case will help the defense side in our case. If the plaintiff (Shauna) in
        our case is an employee who works on a daily basis, she must provide evidence that she is
        exempt under FLSA provisions, which is “​
        from both the minimum wage and overtime pay
        provisions due to the nature of her job”, such that she has a claim for payment of her hourly
        wage for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. Therefore, the defense in our proposed
        case could use this case's decision as a base to prove that the plaintiff (Shauna) is exempt from
        overtime payments.

      <p id="break_lines">
        Morrison et al. v. County of Fairfax discusses whether the fire captains fall within an
        exception, which includes certain “executive” and “administrative” employees whose primary job
        duties were related to management, to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) so that they were
        not entitled to overtime compensation. The case touches upon the following legal elements:
        FLSA exemptions and Exemption Status of Employee based on actual duties, which are
        described next.
        According to the outcome of the case, the County failed to provide enough evidence
        that the fire captains' primary duties included doing executive or administrative works and that
        they[fire captains] had spent majority of their time doing these types of duties. Similar to the
        firefighters of lower ranks, the fire captains were also required to perform the same daily duties:
        training, first responding, etc. The decision was established by the United States Court of
        Appeals For the Fourth Circuit after it reversed and remanded the district court's decision. The
        decision of the court on this case has been treated positively based on the citing decisions (4​th
        Circuit – Court of Appeals and 4​th​ Circuit – U.S. District Courts) that followed the case.
        This case relates to our case proposal, and it will help us with plaintiff's side (Shauna), as she
        was hired as a software developer and also perform IT services when only needed but was
        frequently required to do the IT stuff by working overtime. The case also shows that the FLSA
        exemptions are supposed to be “narrowly construed against the employer”, and that an
        employer must prove the application of an exemption by providing convincing evidence. And as
        IT duties do not fall under the provisions of FLSA exemptions, the plaintiff(Shauna) could use
        that to prove that she was supposed to get paid the overtime hours that she had worked.

      <p id="break_lines">
        Luzik v Commonwealth is in regards to a group of over one hundred juvenile probation officers
        who are suing the Commonwealth of Virginia for allegedly not paying them overtime.
        It concerns itself with the burden of proof the Commonwealth must present that their employees
        are exempt by FLSA (Fair Labor Standards Act). The court trial case found that they were salaried
        and their duties were administrative which would make them exempt and owed no overtime pay.
        The Supreme Court vacated this judgement however, and remanded the case.
        They then found that the officers passed the Salary Basis Test, but fail the Duties Test.
        The latter was not properly evaluated at the trial court, but here they find that most of the
        officers do not have duties that can be defined as administrative or professional.
        The normal officers' tasks are not pertaining to management policies or general business operations
        and cannot fire or hire staff. They are not professional becauses they did not receive prolonged
        intellectual instruction or study. The judgement was later reversed, but this was due to the
        court's jurisdiction. They were unable to hear their claims. The Commonwealth of Virginia had
        not waived its sovereign immunity from the FLSA. This approaches the definition of “administrative”
        tasks being their best potential argument against being exempt under the Duties Tests: Administrative Exemption.

      <p id="break_lines">
        The case involves the fire department chiefs and lieutenants whom argue that they are manual
        laborers and thus aren’t exempt, but the court rules that they fall under the
        Executive Exemption of the Duties Tests. The claim is that even though the majority of their
        duties may not be executive that they may spend a large portion of their time fighting fires,
        they are still acting in executive capacities. They can be performing managerial duties even
        "while physically doing something else." There was no subsequent appellate history.
        This helps the defendants argue against the plaintiff’s majority IT work. She is still a System Administrator.

I was told that the SysAdmins typically handled IT support for the rest of the office, which tended to interfere with their actual work, especially on crunch days.  Crunch days are when software is pushed to production, or a database goes down, that kind of thing — the entire SysAdmin staff needs to be available.  My job description was to perform systems administration tasks as directed and to perform office IT support on an as-needed basis.  In my contract, I was also informed that as a “computer employee” I was exempt from overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">Once I started, my supervisor, Michael Trump, told me that he would likely assign me most of the IT work; this made sense as it had been hinted that I was hired to take some of the pressure off the team.  I ended up being instructed to perform my SysAdmin tasks in the morning, then make rounds through the office after my lunch break to see if anyone needed help.  The company has an IT help desk website where people can request help, but most people don’t know how to use it so they just don’t.  Because there are about 150 people in the office, these rounds would end up taking most of the afternoon, after which I would have a few remaining SysAdmin tasks to perform.  Typically I’d average an hour of overtime per day on typical days, but that could go up to 4 hours on crunch days.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">The IT tasks were things like making sure computers and other hardware were plugged in (power, video, sound, etc.), helping people set up two-factor authentication, finding “lost” or “deleted” files or emails, setting up accounts on spare computers for interns, cleaning keyboards, refilling paper & ink/toner in printers, and helping people set up wireless & printer access on their desktop computers.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">Occasionally I’d complain online about how tiring my job was.  After about a year, someone suggested that I might have been incorrectly classified as exempt from overtime pay.  At this point I read the section in the FLSA, and it sounded like most of the stuff I was doing was menial tasks and didn’t really fit into the “computer employee” description.  I mentioned this to Michael, but he just said I’d have to talk to HR about stuff like that.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">On my next round I stopped by Stacy Johnson’s office over in HR and mentioned that I didn’t think the exemption applied to me. Stacy seemed distracted by other work and didn’t seem to want to talk about it, and hardly looked away from her work. She said there was nothing she could do; I was hired as a computer professional and was exempt.  After a while it was clear I wasn’t making any headway.  Frustrated, I emailed a lawyer that evening and set up an appointment.</p>
    <h4>Reluctant Information</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">Shauna spent a good portion of her rounds chatting with the people she was helping.  While not technically objectionable under normal circumstances, the work was not done in the most efficient manner.  In addition, the other SysAdmins also frequently work overtime; however this is done while performing actual systems administration tasks.  Finally, when talking to Stacy Shauna became frustrated and raised her voice a little, threatening to sue the company before she had talked to a lawyer about the validity of her complaint.</p>
    
    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Shauna recorded 10~15 hours of overtime per 2-week pay period</li>
      <li>40-60% of Shauna’s work involved office IT tasks, depending on the day</li>
      <li>Although not strictly officially, Shauna was hired to alleviate the SysAdmin’s workload by taking over their IT tasks rather than as just another SysAdmin</li>
      <li>The IT tasks performed by Shauna were very menial</li>
      <li>The response from HR didn’t seem to actually consider Shauna’s argument</li>
      <li>While other sysadmins also worked overtime, they were definitely exempt due to the tasks they were performing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Shauna’s IT work was mostly done after lunch break — before she started her “regularly assigned tasks” related to her job description</li>
      <li>Could argue that if she was more efficient with her rounds she could have avoided overtime</li>
      <li>Shauna was unfamiliar with the actual wording of the FLSA until a year into her job</li>
      <li>Shauna was very new to the field, inexperienced in the workplace & employment laws</li>
      <li>The other sysadmins also worked overtime</li>
      <li>Shauna does not have a paper trail for initial question to HR (asked in-person rather than via email)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Witness Details</h3>
    <h4>Voluntary Information</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">I have worked in payroll for Shananigans for 11 years. For the last 3 years I have been the head of the department. We orignially didn't have an IT department, or help desk website; being a tech company, this wasn't viewed as a very big problem since most employees are savy enough to fix there own problems most of the time. This was never quite the case for our department, we may have one or two employees who we could rely on, but as the company grew there became more problems than they could be expected to handle and still do their own job. About 6 years back this was brought up, but instead of a dedicated department we got some of the more tech savy guys from other departments we could call on. I've always been an advocate for an IT department, but was always told we didn't have room in the budget. About 3 years ago, just before Shauna started working at Shananigans, we got something of a department. It's a few people who mostly sit in tight on their floor in their broom closet. They provided an IT help desk website, that allowed us to submit trouble tickets, but most people are either not aware of it or unclear how it works. I've always prefered to talk to people in person, but nobody ever answers the phone down there. Apprently they find something to do and I'm told they are working, but I never see it.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">This last year or so, our help has mostly come from Shauna. She stops by everyday and we always have something we need help with. Admittedly we have some older employees who may type well enough and turn the computer on and write an email, but most of the complexities of computers excape them. We give Shauna a lot to do somedays, but she is always very patient and helpful. She helped me with network connectivity issues not but a few weeks ago, and she didn't just fix it, but showed me what the problem was and helped me understand how to fix it if it occured again. She is well liked in our department and we certainly give her a lot of work. I've let her know how much we appreciate her. She even gave us her extension so I can call if we need any help, and she answers her phone! In more than one supervisor meeting I've praised her for the work she does for us.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">I found out later that she isn't from the IT department, but is assigned to do IT work as needed, but I see her way more often than our official IT employees. I've never seen her work in a System Admin capacity. Even when she isn't helping me or my department, I see her around the office helping others with various IT related problems. You know, head under the desk, you're computer isn't plugged in sort of stuff. I always leave before her, even on the occasion I stay late. Even though she makes rounds in the later half of her day, she has been known to come help us if we call her extension.</p>
    <h4>Reluctant Information</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">I generally only see Shauna around mid afternoon and while she always responds to her phone, I've learned she isn't always able to come right up to fix our problems in the early morning. I tend to wait until Shauna is available, and only submit trouble tickets when absolutely necessary in the moring.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">I have made several passes on Shauna without any positive results. Since she has made it clear she isn't interested, I have backed off and kept our relationship purely professional, but I may call on her because I like her over the IT departement people. I also may have faked one or more "issues" just so I could see her, but not since she rejected me.</p>
    
    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">He attests to Shauna working past normal hours.
    He can attest to seeing her do IT work more than Admin work.</p>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">Has knowledge of her work schedule and constraints and that she does do System Admin work in the morning.
      He gives her more work and avoids the IT department. It isn't necessarily that the job requires more IT work than the IT department can handle, it's that they call her instead of the IT department. Might be the source of her being over worked in IT. Has fabricated IT work just to see Shauna.</p>
    
    <h2>Client Witness for the Defense — Stacy Johnson</h2>
    
    <h3>Witness Details</h3>
    <h4>Statement</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">I joined Shenanigans Software, Inc. straight out of college after previously interning with the company the summer of my Junior year. When I was an intern, I mainly performed menial tasks such as making copies and brewing coffee for the full time employees, but I still learned the ropes of the job nonetheless. When I received an offer for a full time position following my graduation, I was somewhat reluctant to take the position because I did not want to be making coffee for the rest of my career. However, my hard work during the internship was recognized, and I was given the responsibility of helping manage the payroll for our employees. I have access to a database that logs all employee work hours so that I can properly compensate our hard working employees.</p>


    <p id="break_lines">A few months ago, the employee in charge of hiring for ten years left the company after accepting
    an HR position at Boolgle, which left the HR department in dire need of someone who specialized in 
    the hiring process. The head of the HR department, who was in charge of me during my internship, saw 
    my potential as an excellent hiring manager despite my lack of experience. After receiving some general pointers from a few people who have had hiring experience, I was tasked with hiring the position of Assistant System Administrator, which had recently been created to alleviate the duties performed by our current System Administrators. After an extensive interviewing process, Shauna Pauls was chosen as our new Assistant System Administrator, since she was the most qualified for the position out of our applicants.</p>

    <p id="break_lines">Shauna appeared to excel at her duties over the past few months and she received numerous compliments 
    from employees in other departments. During the last pay cycle, Shauna requested a meeting with me about 
    her current pay. After talking about how tired she was from working frequent overtime hours, she requested 
    compensation for the overtime hours that she was working. Since I had experience with the inner workings of 
    the employee payroll, I had payed many of our employees for their overtime hours, but only employees that 
    were not “computer professionals” and employees in administrative positions. I told her that she was not 
    eligible for overtime hours because she was technically a computer professional, which is exempt from 
    overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act. After telling her this, she became rather angry and 
    threatened to sue our company to get her compensation. I told her that she was being unreasonable and that 
    I was familiar with who can and cannot receive overtime pay, which caused her to storm out of my office
    while mumbling angrily to herself.</p>
	
    <p id="break_lines">When I reported this to the head of the HR department, he was confident in my assessment of the situation 
    and that nothing serious would arise from the situation.</p>
    <h4>Secret Information</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">Stacy is relatively computer illiterate and has no idea what any technical jargon actually means. She hired 
    Shauna because her resume seemed rather impressive after boolgling a few of the technical terms and reading 
    the Wikibedia pages. Stacy has personally received assistance from Shauna when she could not turn on her 
    laptop, which was actually uncharged because she did not plug the cord into the outlet.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">Extra: Stacy shuffled the stack of resumes and randomly pulled out Shauna’s resume for the selection 
    process.</p>
    
    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">Being a recent college graduate, Stacy barely has any actual experience with her job, which may reduce the 
    strength of her testimony. Shauna is the first employee that Stacy has hired, so she may have made some 
    mistakes during the hiring process. Proving that Stacy has no useful knowledge of computers could alter 
    Shauna’s classification as a computer professional.</p>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">Stacy is well aware of the exemptions in the FLSA, since she was responsible for paying all employees 
    regardless of their exemption status. Stacy personally hired Shauna, so she knows the details of her 
    contract and what tasks Shauna is expected to perform. She also has access to the hours worked by each 
    employee, so she knows when someone has worked overtime.</p>
    
    <h2>Friendly Witness for the Defense — Michael Trump</h2>
    
    <h3>Witness Details</h3>
    <h4>Statement</h4>
    <p id="break_lines"> I have been working at Shenanigans Software, Inc. for 9 years already. I started as a Systems Administrator and have been as a Head Systems Administrator for 6 years, where I have my own team that consist of five System Administrators. My duties include assigning tasks to both System Administrators, making sure that the server infrastructure and the process deployment works properly. Here, at Shenanigans Software, Inc., Systems Administrator's' duties include maintaining, installing, configuring, upgrading the servers of the infrastructure and manage continuous deployment of processes. Additionally, I assign my SysAdmins to perform IT duties, such as troubleshooting computers, installing and configuring computer hardware operating systems and applications), in other words, we have a shift rotation policy where each of my SysAdmins performs IT duties for one full-time day.</p>

    <p id="break_lines">So, before hiring Shauna, my team was assigned to urgently upgrade the servers' software and change the databases infrastructure. The software behind our servers was getting outdated, which caused consistent crashes; we had to also change our database storage machines to modern ones and as well as add other machines in order to store more data. It all required the skills and working hours of our SysAdmins, including the ones that had to do IT duties.</p>

    <p id="break_lines">Then, I asked Stacy Johnson (HR) to hire an Assistant System Administrator to perform IT tasks initially until we were done with upgrading the infrastructure. As a result, Stacy hired Shauna. Shauna was new to the field of System Administrator, and in order to upgrade our infrastructure within the given deadline of one month, I decided to assign all of my current SysAdmins to work on the infrastructure, and assign Shauna IT duties until we were done with upgrading the systems.</p>

    <p id="break_lines">Shauna was performing really well by doing the IT duties, and she seemed to be happy with it, as I had a view her workspace from my desk. After we were done with upgrading our infrastructure, I decided to keep my SysAdmins keep working on it, and have Shauna keep performing IT duties, because, like I said she seemed to enjoy doing those duties. I have never seen her sad when she was working here!</p>

    <h4>Secret Information</h4>
    <p id="break_lines">As he thought Shauna was happy by doing IT duties, he decided not to tell her whether she wanted to keep doing IT tasks or also do SysAdmin duties.</p>
    <p id="break_lines">Extra: he knew that because Shauna had to work overtime occasionally while doing IT tasks, she was “potentially” supposed to get paid overtime.</p>
    
    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <h4>Helpful to the Plaintiff</h4>
    <p>Michael Trump, after finishing upgrading the infrastrcture of the system with his SysAdmins, should have talked with Shauna whether she still wanted to keep performing IT duties. Such action decreases the strength of his testimony.</p>
    <h4>Helpful to the Defense</h4>
    <p>According to Michael Trump, he had never seen Shauna complaining about anything while performing assigned IT tasks, instead she seemed to be very happy with her position. Secondly, Shauna was still classified as an Assistant System Administrator who was exempt from overtime pay by the FLSA section.</p>
