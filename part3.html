<h1 id="bgs">Background / Scenario</h1>
<h3>Background</h3>
  <p>-Shauna Pauls's backstory-</p>
  <p>-Shenanigans Software's Backstory-</p>
<h3>Scenario:</h3>
  <p>When Shauna Pauls began work at Shenanigans Software, Inc.,
    her paperwork stated that she was to act as software developer and perform in-office IT services for other employees on an as-needed basis, the same as her peers.
    Her starting salary was a generous but not unusual $28.00 an hour ($58,240 per year) — Shenanigans is a Federal subcontractor with deep pockets.
    However as ‘the new guy,’ all of these IT tasks were given to her so that the other developers could focus on programming.
    As Shauna was frequently required to work overtime to complete all the IT tasks, she asked to be paid an overtime rate but was told that as a programmer she was exempt from Fair Labor Standards special overtime rates.
    Shauna then sued Shenanigans, contending that the majority of her work was menial and non-exempt.

  <p id="summary">Affected Legal Elements and Summary</p>
  <p id="break_lines">
    Jones v. VA Oil Company mainly deals with classifying the overtime exemption status of an employee upon describing the actual duties of an employee. The percentage of work time spent performing a certain task can help determine if that employee’s primary duties will classify them as an employee to which the overtime exemption statute can be applied. The decision
    made in the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit holds precedent in our area, and it has been
    overturned neither by the court itself nor a higher court. The decision has been positively treated
    in cases that have cited it with most courts following the decision. However, some lower courts
    have utilized the decision in other contexts, but further research does not indicate that the
    decision has been misused. This case will help the defense with their argument in our case. The
    plaintiff in this case is employed in a managerial capacity, but they regularly perform duties that
    non-exempt employees perform. The decision shows that an employee can still be exempt from
    the overtime statute even if they perform extra duties that would normally be compensated with
    overtime pay for non-managerial employees. Thus, this could help the defense in our case
    possibly show that the exemption still applies.

  <p id="summary">Affected Legal Elements and Summary</p>
  <p id="break_lines">
    Yuen v. U.S. Asia Commercial Development Corp. discusses whether an employee who occasionally performs the duties of an employee who is exempt from overtime pay still falls under the category of overtime exemption. This questions the classification of the employee based on the normal daily duties of said employee. This case suggests that even if some duties that are considered exempt from overtime pay are performed by the employee, they still may be entitled to overtime pay if their main duties consist of work that is not overtime exempt. This decision was made in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, which holds precedence over our case. There have been no decisions made by a higher court to contradict this decision. Upon reviewing the cases that cited this decision, it appears that the decision has been positively used without mistreatment that would call its validity into question. This case should help the plaintiff’s side demonstrate that the extent of the plaintiff’s duties do not qualify them as a computer professional, even if they occasionally perform tasks that designate them as such. If the plaintiff’s side can show that the plaintiff’s primary duties would be done by an employee who can be compensated by overtime pay, then this case could prove to be useful.
